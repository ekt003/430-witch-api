    <h1>~ Project 1 API Documentation &#9733; ~</h1>
    
    <h2>The site's purpose</h2>
    <p> 
        My API lets you make, save, and export cute little 2D witch icons. It was refreshing to work on something a little more light hearted than my research studio project, which
        was the goal. 
    </p>

    <h2>Part of the app handled by the API</h2>
    <p>
        The API handles all of the user information. This means that it stores user names and icons and then loads them back into the main canvas on request.
    </p>

    <h2>What Went Right</h2>
    <p>
        I like the art and I like the cutesy witch aesthetic I went with. I also <em>actually made</em> mockups for the site and stayed true to them, which rarely ever happens. I also
        wrestled with canvas which is something I hated in 330.
    </p>

    <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
    <p>
        I hard core over committed time to my friends who were struggling this past week instead of working on this project. I have learned nothing and will do it again, but I figured
        that it would probably still be good to say.
    </p>

    <h2>What Would You Add</h2>
    <p>
        I would love to add stuff like colors and more customization in the future are well as a more robust information storage system with logins and the whatnot.
    </p>

    <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized Canvas in a creative way to layer images on top of each other</li>
            <li>Added the ability to export images to PNGs</li>
            <li>Created the ability for players to share their icons via links</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
